## **A Little Bit About Me**
I'm 24 years old and currently in my first year of a financial planning undergraduate.
I was born and raised in the Sunshine Coast, Queensland. The Sunshine Coast is a lot like it sounds, a very surf-centric community. When I was 20 I decided to move to Melbourne and pursue tattooing as it had been my life long goal. I eventually decided to drop tattooing in favour of getting an education. This is with the hope that one day I'll have a job that I can do my best to help other people rather than quite literally hurting them. 

## **Hobbies**
I have a few hobbies, firstly I'm an avid climber. I train for climbing at least 3 times a week and head out to local Melbourne crags every few weeks to test my skills. Secondly, I have an unhealthy relationship with chess. I have played it my entire life but it was not until the last two years that I decided to study and become as good as I can. I don't handle failure very well so as you can imagine that doesn't end well with losing a game. Even so, over time I have learnt to moderate my emotions and have tried to enjoy simply learning new things about the game. 
## **Interests in IT**
Developments in technology especially in the modern-day have always fascinated me. The exploration of subjects that used to be literal science fiction is becoming a reality. It's such an exciting and turbulent time we live in and I can't wait to contribute to it.

As being someone who has grown up with technology for well over half their life I have always been especially interested in games. The concept seems so incredibly complex and fascinating to me. It's like creating a film but the audience is quite literally partaking in the film. All of this curiosity I have to owe to my uncle. When I was young I would always see him playing games like 'Sonic' on his Dreamcast or various first-person shooting or racing games on his PC. 

RMIT is a university I've known about even before I moved to Melbourne. It seemed everyone was doing arts degrees here and were thoroughly enjoying it. This was quite a bright contrast to other friends of mine studying at QUT and not being as enthusiastic about their education. Plus, from an outsiders perspective, the buildings in the city and the students roaming around on Swanston Street always caught my attention for being pretty cool. 

Frankly, I expect to be set up for my career during my studies. To elaborate, I hope to have sufficient knowledge to be able to apply that positively. I hope to be an asset to both my stakeholders and my employers in the future. My goal is to put my best effort into helping people as much as I can. 

## **Ideal Job**

![Advertisment](https://github.com/Blakelowe95/Assigntment---1/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202019-12-04%20at%2011.35.39.png?raw=true)
[www.Seek.com.au/FinancialAnalyst](https://www.seek.com.au/job/40462037?searchrequesttoken=4d3e4df9-bdd7-4200-98e5-ca234b3fd425&type=standard)

The job shown above is one of many advertisements on Seek.com that stand out to me. It was very hard to narrow my preferences down. This job would be an around about estimate of what I'd love to do. To work in a team producing answers to complex problems for the best interest of our business partners and clients. Most of all, the job is based mostly on statistical inferences. I would personally rather work with data and produce answers that are based on facts. 

The most important prerequisites for the job is 3-5 years of strong experience alongside various qualifications including an undergraduate in financial planning and CPA or CA certifications. Following that they ask for someone proficient with Excel and other programs. They also ask for someone who has excellent communication skills as the job may require presentations to people from 'various backgrounds'.

At the moment, I'm far from eligible from obtaining this job. I have very little to offer the employers others than strong authentic communication skills that I've obtained from a history of working in consultation roles. 
Through the course of my degree, I hope to obtain all of the necessary skills required for a job of this calibre. Which I am confident it will do so. The only thing that my degree won't be able to offer me is years of experience in a similar role. I will get a job in a similar role potentially has a paraplanner or an associate analyst as soon as I finish my degree.

### **Thoughts and Reflections**
Upon reflection of the results above, I have obtained many insights about myself that seem to be uncanny and enlightening. What stands out in my mind is that there are three main attributes that I hold. I'm an introvert, very conscientious and on the sensitive side. The first of which I'm not surprised about at all. Although, the second and third gave me interesting insights on who I am and who I can be. In the interest of joining a team, it's apparent to me that I may need to expend a bit more energy on maintaining open, positive lines of communication with my teammates. Whilst holding a somewhat hard shell to any criticism that may come my way. I believe with the three main attributes mentioned and the many more shown in my results above I will be a productive team-mate that will be willing to help anyone in need with the tasks at hand.


### **Project Idea** 
The primary idea is an interactive app showing the location of your pet called "Find my pet". Through a little GPS tracker attached to the pets collar the app will be able to track the animal at all times. Once the app is downloaded on your smartphone or computer you will be able to see exactly where your pet is and where it has been. The app will have an interactive map as the main display with a small side-bar showing various settings and statistics. Some of the statistics may include commonly visited places or the average speed of which your pet travels to places.

Much like 'Find my Iphone', 'Find my Pet' will become an invaluable tool for pet owners around the world. We love and adore our little critters so much that we consider them family, so it should only feel natural treat them with more respect than our pocket sized super computers. When our pets go missing it's both a stressful and frantic time. The goal for creating an application like this is to make the process of bringing our pets home quick and easy.  Now that GPS software has become more available and cheaper to produce we hope to see every pet owner come to ease over the fact that they can trust where their pet is at all times. 

"Find my Pet" will come in the form of both an application for your phone or a website. Both of which will be free to use. The only outlay needed by the customer will be for the purchase of a collar that has a small GPS attached to it. The application will use similar software to Google Maps showing the surrounding areas. Only this time there will be a live feed of where the pet is at all times. There will also be various settings and statistics available to give the owner better insights on what their pet gets up to.
Alarms can be set if the pet passes a range of which the owner may deem as too far from the home. This can be toggled in the settings menu and may be changed from imperial to metric measurements at any time. Once the alarm goes off the owner and any other emergency contacts will be notified. This notification will show the time of which the pet passed this barrier and how far away they are from home. We the person decides to open the notification they will be redirected to either the app or the website where it will show them exactly where the pet is currently. For seamless interaction, the owner can use the same software to find the quickest route to their lost pet. 
Multiple pets may be added to the app. Each GPS can be named and given a little icon such as a dog for example.

There are three main sources of technology needed for this product. Coding software for the application and website, GPS beepers and collars of different sizes and colours. This should all be achieved by a small team of software developers and clothing designers. The aim is to have an app very similar to Google Maps so the learning process for new users can be as smooth as possible. The same applies to the website. The software will be both simple and easily customisable for any developers hoping to add new features. The GPS will be as small as possible, water-proof and shockproof. It will be securely attached to the stitching of the collar so there will be no chance of it accidentally being bumped or bitten off. The collar will also be waterproofed and made of a sturdy recycled material so that there are no chances of it breaking and losing the important GPS. 

If all of what was mentioned above can be achieved cheaply and effectively then I see no doubt in the applications ability to help many people around the world make sure that their pet is safe at all times. The goal is to make the product as affordable as can be for the regular pet owner. Of course the techonoloy can and is encouraged to be used by all kinds of industries such as in the police force or even Guide Dogs Australia. In the future it would come as no suprise to see various other features being added to the product such as health statistics and exercise routines.
