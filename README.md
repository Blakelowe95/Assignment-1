## **Back Ground**
As you may have guessed my name is Blake. I'm 24 years old and currently in my first year for my financial planning undergraduate degree. I was born and raised in the Sunshine Coast, Queensland. The Sunshine Coast is a lot like it sounds, a very surf-centric community. When I was 20 i decided to moved to Melbourne and persue tattooing as it had been my life long goal. I eventually made the decision to drop tattooing in favour of getting an education. This is with the hope that i'll one day, have a job that I can do my best to help other people rather than quite literally hurting them.
