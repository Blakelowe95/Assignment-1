## **Back Ground**
As you may have guessed my name is Blake. I'm 24 years old and currently in my first year of a financial planning undergraduate.
I was born and raised in the Sunshine Coast, Queensland. The Sunshine Coast is a lot like it sounds, a very surf-centric community. When I was 20 i decided to move to Melbourne and persue tattooing as it had been my life long goal. I eventually made the decision to drop tattooing in favour of getting an education. This is with the hope that one day i'll have a job that I can do my best to help other people rather than quite literally hurting them. 

## **Hobbies**
I have a few hobbies, firstly I'm an avid climber. I train for climbing atleast 3 times a week and head out to local Melbourne crags every few weeks to test my skills. Secondly, I have an unhealthy relationship with chess. I have played it my enitre life but it was not until the last two years that I decided to study and become as good as I can. I don't handle failure very well so as you can imagine that doesn't end well with losing a game. Even so, over time I have learnt to moderate my emotions and have tried to enjoy simply learning new things about the game.
