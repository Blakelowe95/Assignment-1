## **Back Ground**
As you may have guessed my name is Blake. I'm 24 years old and currently in my first year of a financial planning undergraduate.
I was born and raised in the Sunshine Coast, Queensland. The Sunshine Coast is a lot like it sounds, a very surf-centric community. When I was 20 i decided to move to Melbourne and persue tattooing as it had been my life long goal. I eventually made the decision to drop tattooing in favour of getting an education. This is with the hope that one day i'll have a job that I can do my best to help other people rather than quite literally hurting them. 

## **Hobbies**
I have a few hobbies, firstly I'm an avid climber. I train for climbing atleast 3 times a week and head out to local Melbourne crags every few weeks to test my skills. Secondly, I have an unhealthy relationship with chess. I have played it my enitre life but it was not until the last two years that I decided to study and become as good as I can. I don't handle failure very well so as you can imagine that doesn't end well with losing a game. Even so, over time I have learnt to moderate my emotions and have tried to enjoy simply learning new things about the game. 

## **Interests in IT**
Developments in technology especially in the modern day have always fascinated me. The exploration of subjects that used to be literal science fiction are becoming a reality. It's such an exciting and turbulent time we live in and I can't wait to make a contribution to it.

As being someone who has grown up with technology for well over half their life I have always been especially interested in games. The concept seems so incredibly complex and facinating to me. It's like creating a film but the audience is quite literally partaking in the film. All of this curiousity I have to owe to my uncle, when I was young I would always see him playing games like 'Sonic' on his Dreamcast or various first person shooting or racing games on his PC. 

RMIT is a university i've known about even before I moved to Melbourne. It seemed everyone was doing arts degrees here and were thoroughly enjoying it. This was quite a bright contrast to other friends of mine studying at QUT and not being as enthusiastic about their education. Plus, from an outsiders perspective the buildings in the city and the students roaming around on Swanston Street always caught my attention for being pretty cool. 

Frankly, I expect to be set up for my career during my studies. To elaborate, I hope to have sufficient knowledge to be able to apply that in a positive way. I hope to be an asset to both my stakeholders and my employers in the future. My goal is to put my best effort into helping people as much as I can.
